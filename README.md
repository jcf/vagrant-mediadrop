MediaDrop is an open source video platform that allows you to…

> Run a powerful video site built in Python on your own
> infrastructure.

This repo makes it easy to get MediaDrop running inside a virtual
machine so you can try it out and decide if it's the right tool for
you.

**Disclaimer:** I'm not affiliated with MediaDrop in any way, and I
can not support installing or configuring it.
